# sicp-clojure

This repository contain the course code for the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman.

This code is identical to the official MIT course code, with the exception of it being modified from the original MIT Scheme to Clojure (v 1.8).

This is an early work in progress.

## Installation and execution

The code is based on a leinengen project and dependencies can be downloaded by cloning the repo and using leinengen to pull down the dependencies:
```
$ lein deps
```

I have been using Atom with proto-repl as a development environment, and there is a dependency for this in the project file, which can be removed if not required.
